# Advanced-Regression-Techniques-A-Comprehensive-Guide-to-Predicting-House-Prices


##🏡 Advanced Regression Techniques: Because House Prices Won't Predict Themselves! 🧠

Welcome to the world of predicting house prices, where spreadsheets meet science, and regression models reign supreme. This project takes you on a thrilling ride of data preprocessing, model stacking, and genetic feature selection, proving that machine learning can be both smart and fun.

Check out the linked video for a deeper dive, and let’s connect to share insights and experiments. Together, we can push the boundaries of what machine learning can achieve! 💡✨

#🎯 What's the Deal Here?
**Prepping Like a Pro:**

Missing data? No problem! We impute, we encode, and we drop anything that's 50% empty like it's a bad habit.
Got categorical variables? Boom! They’re now numbers thanks to LabelEncoder.

**Getting Fancy with Features:**

A genetic algorithm (yes, inspired by evolution!) picks the best features. Darwin would approve.

**Model Showdown:**

It's like "America’s Next Top Model" but for regressors:
LinearRegression for the purists.
RandomForest for the nature lovers 🌳.
GradientBoosting for the overachievers.
SVR for the rebels.
DecisionTree for those who like branching out.
The stacking model swoops in as the grand finale, blending all the predictions into one masterpiece.

**Tuning It Like a Pro Chef:**

Using GridSearchCV, we find the perfect seasoning (hyperparameters) for our stacking model. Yum!
Proving We're Awesome:

ROC curves and AUC values put all the models head-to-head in an ultimate fight for glory. Spoiler: the stacking model usually wins.
Bonus: A Q-Q plot because why not check if your predictions are norm-al?

**Visuals that Pop:**

Missing data? We show it off with bar plots.
Predictions? We compare them across models with gorgeous line graphs.
AUC? Oh, we curve it like Beckham.
